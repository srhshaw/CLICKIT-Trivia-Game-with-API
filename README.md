# Project-1-Trivia-API

For this project I will build a trivia game that uses Axios calls to the Open Trivia Database API as the source of its question and answer material. 

The Test.JSON file contains a data object response from an API call to the Open Trivia Database API placed through ThunderClient.  The file demonstrates the data structure.  The trivia questions and multiple choice answers from this data will but used to populate the game. 

The Pseudocode.md file lays out the basic steps of the game flow and indicates the points in which API calls, DOM manipulation, and logic algorithm(s) must be constructed within the code.

The Trivia Wireframe 2.drawio.png file shows a mockup of the design layout that will be used as a guide in styling with CSS.  The design will be simple, engaging, and intuitive requiring no learning curve to use and easy play & mobility.

The html file will be attached to a JS Script file, the Axios library, and a CSS file for styling the user interface on the screen.  There will be an h1 title and 5 empty elements that will be populated with question and multiple choice answers response data. There will be text elements to display correct or incorrect answer messages and a button element for the 'Next Question?' game continuation prompt.  

The JavaScript file will house DOM elements for manipulating the questions, interactive answers, response messages, and play continuation button.  It will contain answer choice mapping and correct/incorrect answer logic as well as the game flow and functionality.

The CSS file will be styled clean and modern with a minimum of distraction both in design and color.  The styling will incorporate flexible design to make the game appealing and easy-to-use for mobile players.  

Challenges will include making the API calls and populating the response data to the html accurately, legibly, and in the desired format; mapping the user choice responses and correct answer match logic; and conditional messages and input request.
